# CEPARCO_IP
- "PARCO Integrating Project parallel" contains the parallelized ViBE algorithm
- "PARCO Integrating Project real" contains the basic C code
- Everything is already included within the VS solutions (input video, extra files, etc) so just run and it should be fine
- Output videos should be in the "PARCO Integrating Project parallel/PARCO Integrating Project parallel" or "PARCO Integrating Project real/PARCO Integrating Project real" folders along with the rest of the files
- Default output video is 5fps because processing large fps takes long
- If the input video titled "short.mp4" cant be loaded because it's too large for git, here's an alternative link to copy paste into the folders mentioned above: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gzh8Kjfhrz5VFJ5lVa8d7atMygARJhzE?usp=sharing
