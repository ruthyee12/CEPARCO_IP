# CEPARCO Integrating Project

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the ViBE background subtraction algorithm using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) parallelization with AVX/AVX2 instructions. The implementation is designed for processing CCTV or stationary camera footage in real-time, providing an efficient method for background subtraction on devices lacking GPU acceleration.

To ensure correctness and efficiency, a non-parallelized C/C++ benchmark implementation is provided for verification. Parallelized ViBE was also conducted against OpenCV's Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm, parallelized through threads. 
## Project Structure

- comparing the GMM is just for curiousity purposes

## How to Run the Project
- download ffmpeg through: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
- the guide on how to download ffmpeg can be found here: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows
- open the Visual Studio solution provided in the repository.
- run the appropriate project (PARCO Integrating Project parallel for the SIMD implementation, or PARCO Integrating Project real for the basic implementation).
- the output video will be generated in the corresponding folder: PARCO Integrating Project parallel/PARCO Integrating Project parallel or PARCO Integrating Project real/PARCO Integrating Project real
- the default output video is set to 5 FPS for efficiency, as higher FPS requires more processing time.
- if the input video titled "short.mp4" cant be loaded because it's too large for git, here's an alternative link to copy paste into the folders mentioned above: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gzh8Kjfhrz5VFJ5lVa8d7atMygARJhzE?usp=sharing
- to run GMM code, you need OpenCV.

## Parallelization Approach
### (1) Original ViBE Algorithm (without AVX)
In the original, sequential ViBE algorithm:
- Each pixel in the current image is compared with the corresponding pixel in the history image.
- If the difference between the pixel values exceeds a predefined threshold, the pixel is marked for further processing.
- The segmentation map is updated based on the threshold check, one pixel at a time.
  
This is done in the following steps: 

(1) First History Image Processing and (2) Next History Image Processing

(3) Output Mask

This approach processes pixels individually, which becomes inefficient for large images due to the lack of parallelism.

### (2) Parallelized ViBE Algorithm (with AVX)
Instead of processing each pixel sequentially, we now leverage AVX registers to process 32 pixels simultaneously. The key optimizations include:
- Vectorized Loading: We load 32 pixels into a 256-bit AVX register at once.
- Broadcast Threshold: The threshold value is broadcast to all 32 positions in the register.
- Vectorized Subtraction: The absolute differences between the current and history image pixels are calculated using SIMD instructions.
- Threshold Comparison: Each comparison is done for 32 pixels in a single instruction.
- Segmentation Update: The segmentation map is updated in parallel, modifying 32 pixels at once.

## Peformance Analysis
# Debug mode - ViBE Algorithm Performance (at 5 FPS):
| Implementation                                         | Speedup Ratio |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| ViBE (Non-Parallelized)  vs.   ViBE (Parallelized)     | 1.367309899   | 

- The ViBE (Parallelized) is 1.37x faster than ViBE (Non-Parallelized) in Debug mode. 
- The performance boost is mainly due to SIMD optimizations, though Debug Mode overhead (such as additional runtime checks) still affects execution.
- By handling 32 pixels per instruction cycle, the algorithm reduces computational workload, significantly improving efficiencyâ€”especially for processing large images.


# Release mode - ViBE Algorithm Performance (at 5 FPS):
| Implementation                                         | Speedup Ratio |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| ViBE (Non-Parallelized)  vs.   ViBE (Parallelized)     | 1.019069002   |

- The ViBE (Parallelized) is 1.02x faster than ViBE (Non-Parallelized) in Debug mode.
- In Release Mode, both versions execute much faster compared to Debug Mode, with an overall reduction in execution time.
- However, the performance difference between Parallelized and Non-Parallelized ViBE is minimal, indicating that compiler optimizations already improve efficiency.
- At lower FPS settings, the impact of parallelization is less pronounced.

# Release mode - ViBE Algorithm (at 30 FPS) vs GMM:
| Implementation                                         | Speedup Ratio |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| ViBE (Non-Parallelized)  vs.  ViBE (Parallelized)      | 1.300118431   |
| ViBE (Non-Parallelized)  vs.  GMM (Non-Parallelized)   | 1.702448639   |
| ViBE (Parallelized)  vs.  GMM (Threaded)               | 1.581805638   |

- Parallelized ViBE is ~30% faster than the non-parallelized version, showing that SIMD optimizations effectively reduce execution time at a larger data set.
- Non-parallelized ViBE outperforms non-parallelized GMM by ~70%, indicating that ViBE is inherently more efficient for background subtraction in this implementation.
- Even when GMM is parallelized with threading, ViBE (Parallelized) is still ~58% faster, suggesting that SIMD optimizations provide a greater speed boost compared to thread-based parallelization alone.
- The results demonstrate that SIMD-based ViBE is more suitable for real-time background subtraction at 30 FPS, as it achieves lower execution times than both versions of GMM.
